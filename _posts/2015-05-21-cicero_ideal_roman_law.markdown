This is the first part of a series summarizing the law code described in
Cicero's De Legibus (the Laws). Cicero had intended this to be the law for
a reformed Roman Republic, as the one he had described prior in De Republica
(the Republic).

## On Laws Concerning Magistrates

### Nature of Magistracy

A magistrate is a speaking law, and law a silent magistrate.

### Magisterial Duty

1. Magistrates, with or without *imperium*, shall leave the city when the
   Senate or the people decrees so.
2. Magistrates shall conduct just wars in a just manner.
3. Magistrates shall treat allies with consideration.
4. Magistrates shall exercise control over themselves and their staff.
5. Magistrates shall increase the glory of their country and return home
   with honour.

### Magisterial Power

1. Magistrates shall be obeyed by citizens.
2. Magistrates shall punish the guilty and unruly citizen.
3. Magistrates shall have the right to take auspices.
4. Magistrates shall have the right to conduct trials.
5. Magistrates shall have the right to preside over meetings of the people
   and the Senate.
6. Magistrates (and ex-magistrates) shall form the Senate.
7. The Senate's decrees shall be binding (as laws).

#### Forms of Punishment

* Fine
* Prison (perhaps mean temporary imprisonment before capital punishment)
* Flogging

Once a decision is pronounced by the magistrate, a trial shall take place
before the people (i.e. Century Assembly, Tribal Assembly, and Plebian
Council) to fix the penalty.

A magistrate's ruling may be overturned by an equal or higher authority.
The people may also veto his ruling.

The accused citizen shall have the right to appeal.

Decision of the commanding officer in the field is fixed and final; it is
not subject to veto or appeal.

### Other Limitations on Magistrates

1. One must be 30 years old before seeking an office of Quaestorship.
2. One must be 39 years old before seeking an office of Praetorship.
3. One must be 42 years old before seeking an office of Consulship.
4. One must not hold the same office again until a period of ten years has
   elapsed.
5. One must submit a report to the censors at the end of his office.
6. One is liable to prosecution for any wrong-doings conducted during his
   term of office after his term ends.

### Magisterial Roles

#### Minor Magistrates

* Military Tribunes
* Treasury Officers (i.e. Quaestorship)
* Overseers of Prison and Execution (i.e. *Tresviri Capitales*)
* Overseers of Public Mint (i.e. *Tresviri Monetales*)
* Judges (i.e. *Decemviri Stlitibus Iudicandis*)

Minor magistrates shall obey the Senate's decision.

#### Aedileship

* Public Building
* Food Supply
* Public Entertainment 

Aediles shall obtain memberships of the Senate.

#### Censorship

* Conduct census and organize citizens into respective tribes and orders.
* Monitor public building, treasury, and taxes.
* Regulate family planning.
* PurgeÂ the Senate of disreputable persons.

Two censors share the censorial power and will serve for a term of five
years. The post of censorship shall always be occupied.

#### Praetorship

* Supreme judge in civil cases

The number of praetors shall be decided by the Senate or the People.

It is unclear whether or not praetors shall continue to serve as military
officers in time of war, as in older time and also in Cicero's days.

#### Consulship

* Supreme leader in both civil and military spheres

Two consuls shall be elected each year. They shall share the regal power
bestowed upon the consulship; they are immune from any command or
prosecution, so long as they're still in office.

### Concerning Plebian Power

Resolutions passed in Plebian Council (i.e. Plebiscite) shall be binding
to both the plebians and the patricians.

Ten tribunes shall be elected each year from the plebians by Plebian
Council.

Tribunes shall be sacrosanct.

Tribunes shall propose matters in Plebian Council.

Tribunes shall have the right to preside over meetings of the Senate.

### Concerning Crisis in the State

In time of a particular serious war or civil disorder, the Senate shall
have the right to appoint a Dictator from its members.

When there are no Consuls nor Dicator in office, there shall be no other
magistrates. The Senate shall appoint an Interrex from its members.

#### Dictator Duty and Rights

1. Dictator shall serve for a term no longer than six months.
2. Dictator shall appoint a Master of Cavalry, who holds power equal to a
   Praetor.
3. Dictator shall have equal power to that of both Consuls.
4. Dictator shall be immune from prosecution during or after his term for
   any action conducted during his term of office.

#### Interrex Duty and Rights

1. Interrex shall arrange for the election of Consuls through Century
   Assembly.
2. Interrex shall lay down his office after a period of five days.

Interrex (i.e. *Inter Reges*, between the kings), in theory, holds regal
power equal to that of the ancient Roman Kings. However, this power has not
been exercised in the earlier Republic or in Cicero's days.
